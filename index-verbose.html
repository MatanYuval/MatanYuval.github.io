      <div>
        <p><strong>Adopt-a-Coral</strong> is a crowd-science movement aiming to capture corals over time, one coral at a time.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a voice for corals in the Caribbean and show the world how they change in real time via <strong>crowd-science</strong>.</li>
          <li>Democratize 3D imaging technology for coral reef ecology.</li>

        <strong>What is crowd-science?</strong>
        <p>
          Crowd-science (or citizen science) harnesses the collective power of volunteers to gather scientific data at scale. 
          In our case, divers and snorkelers worldwide become the eyes and hands documenting coral health in real time.

  <!-- WHY CARIBBEAN SECTION -->
  <section class="card" id="why-caribbean">
    <h2>Why the Caribbean?</h2>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Caribbean reefs are the lifeline of coastal communities,</strong> providing food, coastal protection, tourism income, and cultural identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, they are among the fastest-declining reefs on the planet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          Reef-building stony corals are turning from marvelous living structures into rocks covered in algae. 
          Caribbean reefs are some of the most diverse and rich in the world, and their collapse could trigger unprecedented biodiversity loss.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Caribbean reefs need us the most.</strong></p>

    </div>

    <h3>The gaps we are trying to fill</h3>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <h4>1. Time gap in monitoring</h4>
        <p>
          Most marine scientists spend only a few months per year in the field, and the rest in the lab.
          That is not enough to document changes as they are happening on the reef.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our solution:</strong> work with local dive shops and NGOs that dive the reef every day to document changes in individual coral colonies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>2. AI not fully used for nature conservation</h4>
        <p>
          AI technologies have enormous potential for detecting, classifying, and tracking changes in coral reefs,
          but the training datasets for colony-scale change detection are extremely limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our solution:</strong> build an open, long-term 3D dataset of corals that can be used to train AI models for reef management and conservation.

  <!-- HOW TO ADOPT SECTION -->
  <section class="card" id="how-to">
    <h2>How to adopt a coral</h2>
    <p>
      You don't need to be a scientist. If you dive or snorkel, you can adopt a coral and start contributing to this dataset.
    </p>

    <h3>Step-by-step</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose a coral</strong> that you like and will be able to find again.<br>
        Ideally it should be close to a distinguishable feature such as a mooring line, a large sponge, a crack in the reef, or a characteristic rock.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Capture a video of the coral.</strong><br>
        Swim slowly around the colony for ~30 seconds, keeping a steady distance and overlapping views.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make a 3D model from the video</strong> using a free app, for example:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://lumalabs.ai" target="_blank">Luma</a> – Fast, cloud-based processing, great for beginners</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.kiriengine.app" target="_blank">KIRI Engine</a> – Professional quality, more control over output</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fill in the participant sheet</strong> with basic information:
        site name, approximate coordinates (or GPS if available), depth, date, your name, and any notes on the coral (e.g., species, health observations).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload the 3D model</strong> to the open-source database (see <a href="#data">Data & workflow</a> for details).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repeat every few months</strong> for the same coral to capture its story over time. You can also adopt new corals as you dive.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips from the pros for underwater 3D modeling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Move slowly and smoothly,</strong> like you're filming a movie, not chasing a fish.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep the coral in the center of the frame</strong> and maintain similar distance as you go around.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid big lighting changes;</strong> mid-day natural light often works well. Avoid diving during sunrise/sunset.</li>
      <li><strong>Try not to stir up sand or sediment</strong> around the coral—it creates visual noise in the model.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't touch or stand on the reef.</strong> Ever. Use buoyancy control to maintain position.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap your shots:</strong> Make sure each frame connects to the next. Aim for 50-70% overlap.</li>
      <li><strong>Film the context:</strong> Include some reef structure around the coral for context and scale.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DATA & WORKFLOW SECTION -->
  <section class="card" id="data">
    <h2>Data & workflow</h2>
    <p>From your dive video to open 3D models for coral research and AI.</p>

    <h3>What happens with your data?</h3>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <p>
          You do <strong>not</strong> need to upload raw videos.
          Instead, you upload the resulting 3D model (mesh / textured model) to a shared space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models are stored in an open repository (initially cloud storage, then long-term archiving on open platforms such as Zenodo)
          under a Creative Commons license so they can be reused for research, conservation, and AI development.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>In short:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You keep control of your original footage.</li>
          <li>The shared 3D models are open for non-commercial research and conservation.</li>
          <li>Metadata is kept as simple as possible but scientifically useful.</li>
          <li>You are credited and acknowledged for all contributions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Suggested workflow for model capture and upload</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Record a clean video loop around the coral (30-60 seconds, steady pace).</li>
      <li>Load the video into a 3D reconstruction app (e.g., KIRI Engine or Luma).</li>
      <li>Let the app generate the 3D model (processing may take 5–30 minutes depending on video length and app).</li>
      <li>Export the model in a standard format (e.g., GLB, OBJ, FBX, or PLY).</li>
      <li>Fill in the participant sheet with metadata: site, coordinates, depth, date, coral species (if known), health notes.</li>
      <li>Upload the model + metadata to the shared drive (link provided by the project).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Coral tracked over time</h4>
    <p>
      The real power of Adopt-a-Coral emerges when we rescan the same coral colony across months and years. 
      These time-series models show how corals recover from bleaching, grow, or decline. 
      <strong>This is where the science happens.</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Example time-series narrative:</strong>
      <p>
        <em>Montastraea colony "Taganga-A1"</em>: Baseline scan (November 2024) → Rescan after bleaching event (March 2025) → Recovery monitoring (September 2025). 
        Digital models allow us to measure polyp density changes, surface area changes, and color shifts with precision impossible in traditional surveys.

    <p><strong>Field notes from the Caribbean: corals, people, and everything in between.</strong></p>

    <article>
      <h3>Taganga: first adopters in the bay</h3>
      <small class="muted">Colombia · November 2025 · Field dispatch</small>
      <p>
        Working with Louis in Taganga has been eye-opening. The bay here is a true nexus—tourists come to dive, 
        local fishermen know every nook of the reef, and the reefs themselves are struggling under the weight of pressure. 
        We identified our first five corals to adopt, nestled in the shallow bay next to the mooring lines where boats tie up. 
        Louis has committed to revisiting them every three months, even when tourism is slow. 
        The excitement in his eyes when he saw the first 3D model rendered on his phone was everything. 
        This is what crowd-science can be: partners who care, technology that empowers, and data that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most striking was a large <em>Montastraea</em> (star coral) that shows signs of recent bleaching—pale bands of tissue against the darker healthy polyps. 
        Louis hadn't thought much about it before, but seeing it in the 3D model, we could point to exactly where the stress occurred. 
        Over time, we'll track whether this coral recovers or if the bleaching spreads. That's the real power here.
      </p>

      <h3>Bocas del Toro: filming corals in the mangrove shadows</h3>
      <small class="muted">Panama · October 2025 · Field dispatch</small>
      <p>
        The reefs around Bocas del Toro are phenomenal—dense, colorful, and fragile. Alex, our partner dive operator, 
        took me to sites where the stony corals are still robust, but where bleaching has left visible scars from the 2023 event. 
        We filmed a massive <em>Montastraea</em> colony that looked strong on the outside but had suffered significant bleaching 
        two years ago (visible as a band of lighter tissue running through the center). The rest of the colony has recovered, resuming its usual brown coloration.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is exactly the kind of change we want to capture over time. The 3D model will serve as a baseline; 
        if we rescan it in 2026 and 2027, we'll have a digital record of recovery (or further decline). 
        We can measure the polyp density, surface texture, and color changes with precision. That's what traditional surveying can't do. 
        That's the power of this dataset—not just yes/no health assessments, but quantitative, 3D change over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alex is already excited about adopting 8–10 more corals in his regular dive sites. He sees this as a way to make his daily work feel more scientific, more purposeful.

      <h3>Honduras and ReefMatters: scaling the science</h3>
      <small class="muted">Honduras · September 2025 · Field dispatch</small>
      <p>
        Meeting Ben and Mariam at ReefMatters was a pivotal moment. They operate across several dive sites in Honduras 
        and have been monitoring reef health for years through traditional underwater surveys (species counts, health assessments, photoquadrats). 
        Now, with 3D imaging, they're excited to layer in colony-level resolution on top of their site-level data. 
        They see Adopt-a-Coral as a way to deepen their science without adding too much burden to their day-to-day diving.
      </p>
      <p>
        They've already adopted 12 corals across four sites and are training other dive guides in their network to do the same. 
        One of their guides, Miguel, had never done 3D imaging before, but after a single tutorial, he successfully captured his first model. 
        He was astonished at the level of detail in the output. This is what scale looks like: not top-down mandates, 
        but organic, ground-up growth powered by people who live and work on these reefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ben told me: "This is the first time I've felt like our daily dive data could contribute to real science and real conservation decisions." 
        That's the vision realized.

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Do I need to be a certified diver to participate?</summary>
      <p>
        No. You should be comfortable in water and able to film a coral colony at depth (typically 5–30 meters). 
        Snorkelers can also participate in shallow reef areas. If you're new to diving, we recommend starting with a guided dive from one of our partner shops.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What if I can't find the same coral again?</summary>
      <p>
        That's okay! If you can't locate your original coral, you can adopt a new one. Choosing corals near distinctive reef features (mooring lines, large rocks, sponges) 
        makes them easier to relocate. If you do adopt a new coral, just note it in your metadata.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How much does it cost to participate?</summary>
      <p>
        Participating in Adopt-a-Coral is free. The 3D modeling apps (Luma, KIRI Engine) offer free tiers with generous limits. 
        Your only costs are diving (dive trips through a partner shop) or snorkeling gear if you're doing it independently.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I use my smartphone to film the coral?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes! Modern smartphones have excellent cameras. The key is steady, circular motion around the coral with good lighting. 
        Avoid zooming in and out during filming. A GoPro or other action camera works great too.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What happens to my 3D model after I upload it?</summary>
      <p>
        Your model is stored in the Adopt-a-Coral database under a Creative Commons license. It can be used by researchers, conservation organizations, 
        and AI developers for non-commercial purposes. You will be credited as the data contributor. The model may also be archived long-term on Zenodo.

      <summary>How often should I rescan my coral?</summary>
      <p>
        Every 3–6 months is ideal for detecting meaningful change over time. Monthly rescans are great if you dive frequently. 
        Even annual rescans contribute valuable data. The key is consistency and patience—we're looking at years-long stories.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I use the 3D models for my own research or art projects?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes, if it's for non-commercial use and you credit the original contributor(s). Check the specific Creative Commons license 
        associated with each model (usually CC-BY or CC-BY-NC). Contact us if you have a commercial use case—we can discuss partnership opportunities.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How is the data protected and used responsibly?</summary>
      <p>
        All data is contributed under open Creative Commons licenses. Metadata (like exact coral coordinates) may be shared with trusted conservation partners 
        to help protect reefs from over-harvesting or damage. We never sell data. Decisions about data use are made transparently with community input.
