      <div>
        <p><strong>Adopt-a-Coral</strong> is a crowd-science movement aiming to capture corals over time, one coral at a time.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a voice for corals in the Caribbean and show the world how they change in real time via <strong>crowd-science</strong>.</li>
          <li>Democratize 3D imaging technology for coral reef ecology.</li>
          <li>Develop a community-based dataset to enable the next generation of AI tools for coral research and management.</li>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>What is crowd-science?</strong>
        <p>
          Crowd-science (or citizen science) harnesses the collective power of volunteers to gather scientific data at scale. 
          In our case, divers and snorkelers worldwide become the eyes and hands documenting coral health in real time.

    <h2>Why the Caribbean?</h2>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Caribbean reefs are the lifeline of coastal communities,</strong> providing food, coastal protection, tourism income, and cultural identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, they are among the fastest-declining reefs on the planet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          Reef-building stony corals are turning from marvelous living structures into rocks covered in algae. 
          Caribbean reefs are some of the most diverse and rich in the world, and their collapse could trigger unprecedented biodiversity loss.
        </p>

  <!-- THE GAPS SECTION -->
  <section class="card" id="gaps">
    <h2>The gaps we are trying to fill</h2>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <h3>1. Time gap in monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Most marine scientists spend only a few months per year in the field, and the rest in the lab.
          That is not enough to document changes as they are happening on the reef.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our solution:</strong> work with local dive shops and NGOs that dive the reef every day to document changes in individual coral colonies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>2. AI not fully used for nature conservation</h3>
        <p>
          AI technologies have enormous potential for detecting, classifying, and tracking changes in coral reefs,
          but the training datasets for colony-scale change detection are extremely limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our solution:</strong> build an open, long-term 3D dataset of corals that can be used to train AI models for reef management and conservation.

  <!-- HOW TO ADOPT SECTION -->
  <section class="card" id="how-to">
    <h2>How to adopt a coral</h2>
    <p>
      You don't need to be a scientist. If you dive or snorkel, you can adopt a coral and start contributing to this dataset.
    </p>

    <h3>Step-by-step</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose a coral</strong> that you like and will be able to find again.<br>
        Ideally it should be close to a distinguishable feature such as a mooring line, a large sponge, a crack in the reef, or a characteristic rock.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Capture a video of the coral.</strong><br>
        Swim slowly around the colony for ~30 seconds, keeping a steady distance and overlapping views.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make a 3D model from the video</strong> using a free app, for example:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://lumalabs.ai" target="_blank">Luma</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.kiriengine.app" target="_blank">KIRI Engine</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fill in the participant sheet</strong> with basic information:
        site, approximate coordinates, depth, date, name, and any notes on the coral.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload the 3D model</strong> to the open-source database (see <a href="#data">Data & workflow</a> for details).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repeat every few months</strong> for the same coral to capture its story over time. You can also adopt new corals as you dive.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips from the pros for underwater 3D modeling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Move slowly and smoothly,</strong> like you're filming a movie, not chasing a fish.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep the coral in the center of the frame</strong> and maintain similar distance as you go around.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid big lighting changes;</strong> mid-day natural light often works well.</li>
      <li><strong>Try not to stir up sand or sediment</strong> around the coral.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't touch or stand on the reef. Ever.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DATA & WORKFLOW SECTION -->
  <section class="card" id="data">
    <h2>Data & workflow</h2>
    <p>From your dive video to open 3D models for coral research and AI.</p>

    <h3>What happens with your data?</h3>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <p>
          You do <strong>not</strong> need to upload raw videos.
          Instead, you upload the resulting 3D model (mesh / textured model) to a shared space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models are stored in an open repository (initially cloud storage, then long-term archiving on open platforms such as Zenodo)
          under a Creative Commons license so they can be reused for research, conservation, and AI development.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>In short:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You keep control of your original footage.</li>
          <li>The shared 3D models are open for non-commercial research and conservation.</li>
          <li>Metadata is kept as simple as possible but scientifically useful.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Suggested workflow for model capture and upload</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Record a clean video loop around the coral.</li>
      <li>Load the video into a 3D reconstruction app (e.g., KIRI Engine or Luma).</li>
      <li>Let the app generate the 3D model.</li>
      <li>Export the model in a standard format (e.g., GLB, OBJ, or similar).</li>
      <li>Fill in the participant sheet with metadata.</li>
      <li>Upload the model + metadata to the shared drive (link provided by the project).</li>
    </ol>

      <h3>Taganga: first adopters in the bay</h3>
      <small class="muted">Colombia · Field dispatch</small>
      <p>
        Working with Louis in Taganga has been eye-opening. The bay here is a true nexus—tourists come to dive, 
        local fishermen know every nook of the reef, and the reefs themselves are struggling under the weight of pressure. 
        We identified our first five corals to adopt, and Louis has committed to revisiting them every three months. 
        The excitement in his eyes when he saw the first 3D model rendered on his phone was everything. 
        This is what crowd-science can be: partners who care, technology that empowers, and data that matters.

      <h3>Bocas del Toro: filming corals in the mangrove shadows</h3>
      <small class="muted">Panama · Field dispatch</small>
      <p>
        The reefs around Bocas del Toro are phenomenal—dense, colorful, and fragile. Alex, our partner dive operator, 
        took me to sites where the stony corals are still robust, but where bleaching has left visible scars. 
        We filmed a massive Montastraea colony that looked strong on the outside but had suffered a bleaching event 
        two years ago (visible as a band of lighter tissue). This is exactly the kind of change we want to capture over time. 
        The 3D model will serve as a baseline; if we rescan it in 2026, we'll have a digital record of recovery (or further decline). 
        That's the power of this dataset.

      <h3>Honduras and ReefMatters: scaling the science</h3>
      <small class="muted">Honduras · Field dispatch</small>
      <p>
        Meeting Ben and Mariam at ReefMatters was a pivotal moment. They operate across several dive sites in Honduras 
        and have been monitoring reef health for years through traditional underwater surveys. Now, with 3D imaging, 
        they're excited to layer in colony-level resolution on top of their site-level data. 
        They've already adopted 12 corals and are training other dive guides in their network to do the same. 
        This is what scale looks like: not top-down, but organic, ground-up growth powered by people who live and work on these reefs.
