    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <p><strong>Adopt-a-Coral</strong> is a crowd-science movement aiming to capture corals over time, one coral at a time.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a voice for corals in the Caribbean and show the world how they change in real time via <strong>crowd-science</strong>.</li>
          <li>Democratize 3D imaging technology for coral reef ecology.</li>
          <li>Develop a community-based dataset to enable the next generation of AI tools for coral research and management.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Why the Caribbean?</strong>
        <p>
          Caribbean reefs are the lifeline of coastal communities, providing food, coastal protection, tourism income and cultural identity.
          At the same time, they are among the fastest-declining reefs on the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reef-building stony corals are turning from living structures into rocks covered in algae. 
          Losing them means losing biodiversity and the services reefs provide.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Caribbean reefs need us the most.</strong></p>

    <h2>The gaps we are trying to fill</h2>
    <div class="grid-two">
      <div>
        <h3>1. Time gap in monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Most marine scientists spend a few months per year in the field and the rest in the lab.
          That is not enough to document changes as they are happening on the reef.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our solution:</strong> work with local dive shops and NGOs that dive the reef every day to document changes in individual coral colonies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>2. AI not fully used for nature conservation</h3>
        <p>
          AI technologies have enormous potential for detecting, classifying and tracking changes in coral reefs,
          but the training datasets for colony-scale change are extremely limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our solution:</strong> build an open, long-term 3D dataset of corals that can be used to train AI models for reef management.

    <h2>Get involved</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t need to be a scientist to help. If you dive or snorkel, you can adopt a coral and start contributing to this dataset.
